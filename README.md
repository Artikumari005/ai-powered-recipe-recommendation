# Chefexa – AI Recipe Recommendation App

Chefexa is an AI-powered recipe recommendation web application.
When a user enters the ingredients they have, the app generates suitable recipe suggestions using an AI model.

The goal of this project is to help users quickly discover recipes based on available ingredients, reducing food waste and saving time.
